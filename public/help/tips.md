## Parameters

### Range

Range defines the segment of file name that you would like to manipulate.

- **From** - the beginning of the range

  > **Tips:ðŸ’¡** You don't have to count this number, click at the postion on the file name in Preview pane will populate that value for you.
- **Length** (for Section only) - the length of a section

  > **Tips:ðŸ’¡** Select the section of the file name in Preview pane will populate the value for you.
- **forward** (default) - from the beginning, select farward (left-to-right)  
- **backward** - from the beginning, select backward (righ-to-left)  

### Types

#### Text

Replace / insert some text.  
  >*AdvancedðŸ’¡: Can be a Regexp if Use Regexp is ticked.*

- ***Use Regexp*** - *advanced*
![Use Regexp](./text-regex.png)

> **TipsðŸ’¡:**
>
> 1. Don't put starting and tailing / in the Regexp
> 2. Don't put /gi in the Regexp, tick All for /g and Case-insensitive for /i

#### Section

Previously called Fixed Length (v0.1). Handling by position instead of text.

#### Sequence

Insert / delete / replace sequence.

Parameters:

- **Digits**  
Minimum sequence digits. E.g. Digits is 3, then sequence 1 will be padded with 0s like `001`.  
**When Digits is 0, it means to *DELETE* the sequence found.** In *Insert* operation, Digits is always greater than 1.
- **Step**  
The increment / decrement step of the start number. E.g. Start is 1, Step is 2, then the sequence will be `1, 3, 5`...  
**When Step is 0 in *Re-Sequence*, it means to adjust the sequence digits only.**  
E.g. existing sequence in file names is `1, 2, 3`..., and Digits is 3, Step is 0, then the new sequence will be `001, 002, 003`...  
- **Start**  
The starting value of the sequence.

#### Date

Find the dates element in file names and reformat them.

![Date](./date.png)

- **current format**  
Auto Detect should work most of the times. However can specify from the dropdown list if ambiguous.
- **wiht new format**  
The new year/month/day format

- **Year**  
4 digits / 2 digits / no year  
- **Month**  
2 digits / 3-letter abbreviation (eg. Aug) / full name / no month
- **Date**  
2 digits (with leading 0 if necessary) / 1 digit (no leading 0)
- **Delimiter**  
`- . _ (Space)`

> Currently Date type only supports English locale and the above 4 delimiters. For other delimiters, you'll have to first replace it with one of the supported delimiters and then change it back after the dates re-formmating.

## Batch Renaming Using a CSV File

In some cases, you may find it convenient to define just a comma / tab delimitered file for batch renaming, especially when there are weak / no patterns in the names.

![CSV](./csv.png)

### Switch to CSV mode

In menu `Settings -> Use file list (csv)`. To switch back, go `Settings -> Normal rename`.  
![CSV Mode](./csv-mode.png)

### CSV format

The file just needs two columns:
> Current File Name, New File Name  
...

For example:
> a.txt,x.txt  
b.txt,y.txt  
c.txt,z.txt

**DO NOT** put a header line.

### Delimiters

`, (Tab) ; |` etc. can be automatically recognized. You can also specify it here:
![CSV Delimiter](./csv-delimiter.png)

## Adhoc Renaming

Tick the Inline Edit, you can directly edit the file names in a much quicker way than in Windows Explorer.

![Inline](./inline-edit.png)

## Preferences

Access Preferences via `Settings -> Preferences` menu or the ![Preference](../icon/ios-construct24.png) button in app's Control Panel.

### General
