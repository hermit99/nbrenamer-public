# Why another batch renaming tool?

NB Renamer started as a personal tool to help tidy up file names, especially the downloads ;).

There are many bulk renaming software on the internet, but NB Renamer is created towards simplicity, practicality and user friendness.

Compared to some complex batch renaming tools that are busy as a cockpit, NB Renamer is:

- **Concise and dynamic**
- **Intuitive and interactive**
  - Auto preview changes before the real renaming
  - Populate parameters when click or select
![Basics](public/help/basics.gif)
- **Green and NO Ads, with many other [features](public/help/releases.md)**...

You can find documentation [here](public/help/tips.md) and request feature or report issues [here](https://github.com/hermit99/nbrenamer/issues).

Alternatively you can [contact me](mailto:nbrenamer@gmail.com) directly and I'm keen to hear your feedback and make it better!

## Your support is greatly appreciated

NB Renamer is a [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeware) (Free as in Beer), and it may be open source in the future (Free as in Speech).  
I hope you'll find it useful at times and appreciate your kindness to [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bl5s3cxyr)<a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bl5s3cxyr"><img src="./public/icon/buymeacoffee.png"></a> to support this software.

Thank you,
